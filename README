Name
    nginx_secure_cookie_module - support secure cookie with Nginx

Status
    This module is at its very early phase of development and considered
    highly experimental. But you're encouraged to test it out on your side
    and report any quirks that you experience.

    We need your help! If you find this module useful and/or interesting,
    please consider joining the development!

examples
  a simple example
    location / {

        secure_cookie $cookie_CAPTCHA_SESSION,$cookie_CAPTCHA_EXPIRES;
        secure_cookie_md5 private_key$binary_remote_addr$cookie_CAPTCHA_EXPIRES;

        if ($cookie_CAPTCHA_SESSION = "") {
            #rewrite ^.*$ http://the_captcha_server/ last;
            rewrite ^.*$ /set_secure_cookie$request_uri last;
        }

        if ($cookie_CAPTCHA_EXPIRES = "") {
            #rewrite ^.*$ http://the_captcha_server/ last;
            rewrite ^.*$ /set_secure_cookie$request_uri last;
        }

        if ($secure_cookie = "") {
            return 403;
        }

        if ($secure_cookie = "0") {
            return 403;
        }

        root   html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

     #You can add a captcha page here or in another server. If the user 
     #pass the verification, then you can add this secure cookie by 
     #Nginx or by your application.

    location /set_secure_cookie {

        secure_expires  3600;
        secure_cookie_md5 private_key$binary_remote_addr$secure_cookie_set_expires;

        add_header Location "http://your_host$request_uri";
        add_header Set-Cookie "CAPTCHA_SESSION=$secure_cookie_set_md5";
        add_header Set-Cookie "CAPTCHA_EXPIRES=$secure_cookie_set_expires";

        return 302;
    }

    And the request example is like this:

     $wget -d --header="Cookie: CAPTCHA_SESSION=k7nV0tpVhGgxpP7Tz9JzVA==; CAPTCHA_EXPIRES=1392559708" http://your_host/

Description
    Add the support of secure cookie with Nginx. This module can be used to
    add and verify secure cookie for some real requests and deny any
    malevolent request.

Directives
  secure_cookie
    syntax:*secure_cookie $md5_hash[,$expires_time]*

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location*

    description: This directive specifies the MD5 hash value and the expires
    time of this secure cookie. The $md5_hash should equal to the hash value
    of string which specified by "secure_cookie_md5". The $expires_time is
    the seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. If you did not add the
    $expires_time, then the secure cookie will never be expired.

  secure_cookie_md5
    syntax:*secure_cookie_md5 $the_string_you_want_to_hashed_by_md5*

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location*

    description: This directive specifies the string you want to be hashed
    by MD5. The string can include variables. The hash equation is like
    this:

    hash_string := base64(md5($the_string_you_want_to_hashed_by_md5));

  secure_cookie_expires
    syntax:*secure_cookie_expires expires_time*

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location*

    description: Set the expires time for the secure cookie. It's used to
    produce the variable $secure_cookie_set_expires. Default expire time is
    1 day. The unit of time can be: s(second,default), m(minute), h(hour),
    d(day), w(week), M(month), y(year).

Variables
  $secure_cookie
    description: The hash value computed from secure_cookie_md5 compares
    with the $md5_hash which specified by "secure_cookie". If the result is
    the same, the variable of $secure_cookie is '1'. If the local time has
    exceeded the $expires_time, $secure_cookie is equal to '0'. Otherwise,
    it's null string.

  $secure_cookie_set_md5
    description: The result of hash value with the string specified in the
    directive "secure_cookie_md5".

  $secure_cookie_set_expires
    description: This variable equals to current seconds plus the expires
    time which set by "secure_cookie_expires".
